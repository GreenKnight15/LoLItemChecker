LoL Item Checker is a web application that allows users to view champion stats, rune pages, and item information.

Users can use these forms of information in order to make item sets to optimize thier play style.

There is a downloadable file after a user makes an item set to be placed in their League of Legends App. 
<br/>
Save File to<br/> League of Legends\Config\Global\Recommended\
<br/>
To save to a Specific Champion
<br/>
Add the file to League of Legends\Config\Champions\{championKey}\Recommended\ If the folders are not there make them(*Mac* Global/Recommended)
<br/>

I used Angular.js, Node.js, Angular-Material, JQuery, along with Riot Game's League of Legends API.
